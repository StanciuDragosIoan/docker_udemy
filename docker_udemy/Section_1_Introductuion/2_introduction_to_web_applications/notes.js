    a web pased = any program that is accessed over a network connected using HTTP
    rather than existing within a device's memory

            *not using the device for computer, instead we just access the result
            of the requested data from the web interface

            Advantages: 
                performance not limited by hardware they are run on
                no more hardware requirements
